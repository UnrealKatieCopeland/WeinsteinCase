        This page organizes key statements from Plaintiffs’ counsel’s December 4, 2025 email exchange 
        and places them alongside the governing statutory framework (Fair Housing Act, Texas Fair 
        Housing Act, and Texas Property Code). It is provided as an aid to the Court in understanding 
        the points of disagreement.

            Plaintiffs reaffirm the validity of a Notice to Vacate and associated rent claim for a period

            The email indicates that medically necessary items will be delivered once they are

            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Tex. Prop. Code §§ 92.331–92.335</span> create a presumption of retaliation 
              where adverse actions (such as nonrenewal) follow a tenant’s good-faith complaints or 
              exercise of rights within six months.
            </li>
            <li>
              A retaliatory lease termination is not enforceable and the tenancy is treated as continuing 
              for purposes of the statute.

            <li>
              <span class="font-medium">Tex. Prop. Code § 92.052</span> imposes a non-waivable duty on landlords to

            <li>
              When a unit is determined to be unsafe for occupancy, ongoing rent demands for that 
              period raise questions under both habitability and retaliation provisions.

            <li>
              Timely access to medications and medical devices is typically treated as fundamental to

              noncompliance.

              The merits of any retaliation, habitability, or damages claims can be addressed in 
              later proceedings; this summary is intended only to assist the Court in evaluating 
              the December 4 email in light of the applicable legal framework.
