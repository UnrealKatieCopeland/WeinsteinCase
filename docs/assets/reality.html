    This page is intended to organize information already in the record and to explain why repair, safety,
    displacement, and disability accommodations are central to this case. It is not offered as stand-alone evidence;
    each point is supported by filings, reports, and exhibits previously or concurrently provided to the Court.
  </div>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">📋</span> Basic Facts</h2>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <h3>Who</h3>
    <p><strong>Defendant:</strong> Kathryn Copeland – disabled tenant with traumatic brain injury (TBI), mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and related conditions affecting stamina, immunity, and cognitive processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Plaintiff:</strong> Weinstein Management Co., Inc. – owner/manager of The Bowery at Southside apartments.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>What</h3>
  <p>
    Toxic mold and long-term water damage rendered Defendant’s unit uninhabitable. Two professional reports –
    BioTex (June 18) and Dallas Mold Consultants (September 8) – describe the unit as unfit for human occupancy and
    indicate that all contents were contaminated.
  </p>

    </figure>
  </div>

  <h3>Evidence Snapshot</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>BioTex inspection report (June 18, 2025) – unit deemed unfit for occupancy.</li>
    <li>Dallas Mold Consultants protocol (September 8, 2025) – heavy mold, “all contents contaminated.”</li>
    <li>Subsequent correspondence, notices, and motions filed in this Court and JP Court.</li>
  </ul>

    </figure>
  </div>

  <h3>Current Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Defendant has been effectively homeless since July 14 (hotel through October 27, then staying with others).</li>
    <li>All property was removed between September 22–26; no prior court order and no formal inventory provided.</li>
    <li>Medical equipment (including CPAP), medications, clothing, and other essentials were among the removed items.</li>
    <li>Defendant is pro se and disabled, attempting to litigate complex civil-rights and property claims without stable housing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">🔥</span> Five Key “Smoking Gun” Issues</h2>

  <p>These are the core events that explain why this case raises serious repair, civil-rights, and due-process concerns.</p>

  <details open>
    <summary>🚨 1. Property Removed Before Any Court Order</summary>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sept 22–26:</strong> Reign Restoration removes essentially all contents from the apartment.</li>
        <li><strong>Sept 19:</strong> TRO is filed asking for permission to remove property.</li>
        <li><strong>Oct 16:</strong> Temporary injunction is granted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Property removal occurred before the Court authorized such action. This implicates Texas Property Code
        provisions governing exclusion/lockout and control of tenant property, in addition to civil-conversion theories.
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>📄 2. Dallas Mold Report Not Disclosed for 49 Days</summary>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sept 8:</strong> Dallas Mold Consultants report created (“no equipment on site,” “all contents contaminated”).</li>
        <li><strong>Sept 19, Oct 2, Oct 16:</strong> Three proceedings occur without disclosure of this report.</li>
        <li><strong>Oct 21-23:</strong> Ms. Copeland obtains the report herself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Dallas Mold report undercuts the narrative that Defendant obstructed remediation and supports her position
        regarding habitability and contamination. The timing and non-disclosure at critical hearings are central to her
        fraud-on-the-court and due-process concerns.
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>🧩 3. Eleven-Day Coordination Between Insurance and Non-Renewal</summary>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aug 15:</strong> Insurance adjuster confirms housing will continue “until remediation is completed.”</li>
        <li><strong>Aug 26 (11 days later):</strong> Non-renewal notice is issued, creating an October 26 lease end date.</li>
        <li><strong>Oct 27:</strong> Housing is terminated one day after the "lease expiration."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The close timing between the unconditional housing assurance and the non-renewal that later becomes the basis
        for ending housing is at the heart of Defendant’s bad-faith, retaliation, and coordination arguments.
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>📝 4. Misstated Hotel Offer Date in Later Filing</summary>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>A declaration asserts that a hotel was “offered July 7.”</li>
        <li>The record reflects: ServPro visit did not occur until July 11, and hotel check-in was July 14.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Under the Property Code, the repair-and-remedy deadline tied to the June 27 demand was July 4. The later date
        in the declaration obscures the actual delay and is relevant to Defendant’s statutory repair claims.
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>🔐 5. Unauthorized Entries After Preservation/Spoliation Demand</summary>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aug 17:</strong> Defendant sends a preservation/spoliation letter requesting that entries cease and evidence be preserved.</li>
        <li><strong>Aug 20:</strong> Another entry occurs three days later without Defendant’s consent or presence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These events are central to her claims of improper entry, retaliation, and spoliation. Each post-demand entry
        implicates Property Code § 92.0081 and supports her request for a preservation/inventory order.
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">📅</span> Timeline of This Court’s Proceedings</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>September 29, 2025 – Emergency Motion (Property Removal):</strong> Filed after loss of access to property. Status: not ruled upon.</li>
    <li><strong>October 16, 2025 – Temporary Injunction Hearing:</strong> Defendant logged in shortly after the start time; she was not called to speak, and the TI was granted based on the then-available record.</li>
    <li><strong>October 23, 2025 – Ms. Copeland files Defendant’s Emergency Motion to Vacate Temporary Injunction and Enter Affirmative Relief by Submission seeking Interim Relief:</strong> Filed to present new evidence of obstruction, fraud on the court, constructive eviction, and applicable laws. Court agrees to rule by submission set for October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>October 29, 2025 – Court Denies Ms. Copeland's Emergency Motion to Vacate Temporary Injunction and Enter Affirmative Relief:</strong> Status: denied without written findings.</li>
    <li><strong>November 19, 2025 – Ms. Copeland files Verified Motion for Limited Reconsideration of October 29, 2025 Order & Temporary Mandatory Injunction Request:</strong> Ms. Copeland includes new evidence, controlling case law on constructive eviction, and seeks relief from the Court.</li>
    <li><strong>December 3, 2025 – First Amended Motion for Appointment of Counsel:</strong> Filed with documentation of disability, complexity, and prior denials. Status: hearing not yet set.</li>
    <li><strong>December 9, 2025 – JP Court Hearing (Repair &amp; Remedy):</strong> Parallel proceeding on related Property Code violations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The JP hearing outcome will provide an independent judicial perspective on whether the landlord met its repair
    obligations under the Texas Property Code.
  </p>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">🏥</span> Disability and ADA Accommodation Reality</h2>

  <h3>Diagnosed Conditions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with ongoing cognitive and processing limitations.</li>
    <li>Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and immune dysfunction.</li>
    <li>Chronic fatigue and related autonomic issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Functional Impact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each in-person appearance results in days to weeks of worsened symptoms and limited functioning.</li>
    <li>Processing complex information in real time during oral hearings is substantially impaired.</li>
    <li>Written format and additional processing time are necessary for meaningful participation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Accommodation History</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In a prior case, Judge Pearson implemented a transcript-based accommodation procedure that allowed Defendant to participate effectively.</li>
    <li>In this case, the Court has permitted some Zoom appearances and submissions but has not yet formally addressed her requested modifications to the hearing format (e.g., written questions, extended time, staged proceedings).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The practical problem is a Catch-22: Defendant must participate in live hearings to obtain accommodations, but
    her disability is precisely what limits her ability to participate in that format. Proceeding without appropriate
    accommodations risks undermining due-process protections.
  </p>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">💰</span> What Is at Stake</h2>

  <p>This is more than a standard landlord–tenant dispute. The claims implicate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fair Housing Act (FHA) disability discrimination and failure to accommodate.</li>
    <li>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements for reasonable accommodations in court access.</li>
    <li>Texas Property Code repair-and-remedy and retaliation provisions.</li>
    <li>Insurance bad faith under Texas Insurance Code § 541.060.</li>
    <li>Conversion, constructive eviction, and spoliation of evidence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A comparable federal case, <em>Megan White v. Weinstein</em> (N.D. Tex. 4:25-cv-00312-O), also involves mold
    at the same property and alleges similar patterns of conduct. Together, these matters suggest that the damages
    exposure may be in the seven-figure range when civil-rights remedies, treble damages, and fee-shifting are
    considered.
  </p>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">🎯</span> What Defendant Is Actually Requesting</h2>

  <h3>1. Appointment of Counsel (FHA § 3613(c))</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Meritorious claims supported by professional reports and the parallel JP case.</li>
    <li>Financial inability to retain counsel while homeless and without income.</li>
    <li>High complexity (FHA/ADA, bad faith, discovery, sanctions, and intertwined civil-rights issues).</li>
    <li>Documented history of multiple attorneys declining representation despite merits.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Fair Housing Act explicitly contemplates fee-shifting to the prevailing party. Law school civil-rights
    clinics (such as Texas A&amp;M) and CJA-style panels often accept court referrals in cases of this type.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Interim ADA-Compliant Housing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Not luxury accommodations, but medically appropriate, fragrance-free, mold-conscious housing.</li>
    <li>Ability to stabilize health enough to participate in depositions, discovery, and hearings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Property Inventory and Preservation Order</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>More than 75 days elapsed without access to critical medical equipment and personal property.</li>
    <li>Ongoing risk of spoliation if property is handled outside of licensed remediation protocols.</li>
    <li>Request for a clear, court-supervised inventory and lawful handling consistent with contamination laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">📊</span> Why the Filings May Look Like “Emergency Spam”</h2>

  <p>From the Court’s perspective, it may appear that there is a pattern of repeated emergency filings. From Defendant’s perspective:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The September 29 motion was not ruled upon, prompting the October 29 motion.</li>
    <li>The October 29 motion was denied without findings, while displacement and loss of property continued.</li>
    <li>ADA requests and appointment-of-counsel requests have not yet been given a focused hearing.</li>
    <li>Each new emergency filing attempts to address an ongoing, unresolved problem (housing, access to property, accommodations).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Defendant believes that appointment of counsel and a clear ADA accommodations framework would sharply reduce
    the need for emergency filings and allow the case to proceed in an orderly fashion.
  </p>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">⚖️</span> Role of the JP Court Hearing</h2>

  <p>
    The JP Court repair-and-remedy case involves many of the same facts, parties, and alleged Property Code
    violations. If Defendant obtains relief there, it will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide an independent judicial finding on whether Weinstein met its repair obligations.</li>
    <li>Support the argument that Defendant’s claims have merit, reinforcing her request for appointed counsel.</li>
    <li>Create potential issue-preclusion effects that may streamline this Court’s later determinations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Defendant’s concern for Friday’s scheduling hearing is whether she can realistically agree to detailed
    scheduling deadlines—including expert and discovery deadlines—without counsel and without accommodations.
  </p>

  <h2><span class="section-icon">📄</span> Bottom Line for the Court</h2>

  <p>This is not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A tenant simply trying to avoid rent obligations.</li>
    <li>Frivolous or harassing motion practice.</li>
    <li>A refusal to cooperate with the Court’s process.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Instead, this is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A disabled tenant made homeless by a mold-contaminated unit documented by professional reports.</li>
    <li>A person whose property was removed before court authorization and who has gone months without access to essential items.</li>
    <li>A pro se litigant with significant cognitive and medical limitations trying to navigate a complex civil-rights case.</li>
    <li>Someone asking for counsel and ADA-compliant procedures so the Court can fully and fairly evaluate the merits.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The most efficient way to reduce emergency filings and move this case toward resolution is to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Promptly set and hear the motion for appointment of counsel.</li>
    <li>Clarify the ADA accommodations that will govern Defendant’s participation (e.g., written questions, Zoom, staged proceedings).</li>
    <li>Consider the JP Court outcome and existing professional reports as indicia of the case’s seriousness.</li>
  </ul>
